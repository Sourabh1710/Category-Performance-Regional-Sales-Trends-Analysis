# üìä Category Performance Regional Sales Trends Analysis (SQLite + Python)




## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world business analytics scenario where we explore retail sales and profit data to extract actionable insights for regional and category-level performance.  

We used a cleaned Superstore dataset and applied SQL queries within Jupyter to generate segment-wise, category-wise, region-wise, and time-wise sales intelligence.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand sales and profit distribution across regions, segments, and categories
- Use SQL within Python to perform data slicing, grouping, and transformation
- Create visualizations for key business questions using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Build a job-ready analysis workflow that can be explained in interviews

---

## üõ† Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **SQLite** (via `sqlite3`)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- [**Superstore Sales dataset Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
