# Category-Performance-Regional-Sales-Trends-Analysis
In this project, we perform an end-to-end data analysis of Superstore sales using Python, SQLite, and visualization libraries. We'll clean the data, store it in a local SQL database, run SQL queries for insights, and visualize the results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
